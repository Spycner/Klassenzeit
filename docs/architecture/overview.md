# System overview

**Klassenzeit** is a scheduling app for school class time — working
title for a planner that will eventually assign teachers, classes,
rooms, and time slots under constraints. The solver is the heart of
the product; everything else serves it.

## Monorepo layout

## Toolchain surface

- **`mise`** — installs pinned Rust, Python, uv, and cargo tools;
  defines every canonical task (`install`, `test`, `lint`, `dev`,
  `db:up`, `db:migrate`, …).
- **`uv`** — Python package manager and workspace tool. Every Python
  dependency goes through `uv add`; never hand-edit `pyproject.toml`
  dependency sections.
- **`cargo`** — Rust package manager. Both `solver-core` and
  `solver-py` are members of the top-level Cargo workspace.
- **`podman compose`** — local container orchestration (dev DB,
  eventually containerized backend/frontend).
- **`lefthook`** — git hook runner (`pre-commit`: lint; `pre-push`:
  tests; `commit-msg`: `cog verify`).
- **`cocogitto`** — enforces Conventional Commits on every commit.

## Subsystems

- **Database layer** (`backend/src/klassenzeit_backend/db/`) —
  SQLAlchemy 2.0 async on Postgres 17 with Alembic migrations. See
  [`database.md`](database.md) for contributor details.
- **HTTP API** (`backend/src/klassenzeit_backend/main.py`, growing) —
  FastAPI app. Routes are mounted under `/api/*` (see ADR 0010);
  `/api/health` is the liveness probe.
- **Solver** — see `solver/solver-core/` for the Rust crate and its
  benches; `solver/solver-py/` for the PyO3 binding layer.
- **Authentication** — self-rolled cookie-session auth in
  `backend/src/klassenzeit_backend/auth/`. See
  [`authentication.md`](authentication.md) and ADR 0006.
- **Frontend** (`frontend/`) — React 19 + Vite SPA with shadcn/ui,
  TanStack Router + Query, and `openapi-fetch` against the backend's
  OpenAPI schema. `mise run fe:dev` runs the dev server on port 5173;
  it proxies API prefixes to the backend for same-origin cookies. See
  ADR 0007.

## Domain notes

- **Lessons span one or more school classes.** A `Lesson` has a many-to-many
  relationship to `SchoolClass` via the `lesson_school_classes` join table
  (association object). Most lessons map to a single class (the join row is
  one entry); cross-class lessons such as a Jahrgang-level Religion group
  span multiple classes. The solver's wire format mirrors this with
  `school_class_ids: list[UUID]` per lesson. A nullable
  `Lesson.lesson_group_id: UUID` marks lesson groups that the algorithm
  layer co-places into one time-block. See [ADR 0021](../adr/0021-multi-class-lessons.md).

## Decisions

Every load-bearing architectural decision has an entry in
[`../adr/`](../adr/). Read the ADR index first if you want to
understand why the project looks the way it does.
